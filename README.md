# CS-2600-Systems-Programming
This repository stores a few of my projects from my class CS 2600 - Systems Programming.
I took this course at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona.

There are 4 Projects in this repository. 

- One project implements a simple Nim game utilizing the programming language C.
- Another project sorts a column in a CSV file. C program takes in a command line parameter for the column that should be sorted.
  - Column sorted using a node-based Merge Sort algorithm
 - Another project is a bash script that takes two command line parameters, a month and a year. Script then outputs a calander for the month.
 - The last project is a bash script that takes two command line parameters, a file on your computer and a new location for that file. If the file exists, it will rename the file to add a 1, 2, etc.

## Things I learned in this course
- Programming in C
- Introduction to Unix environment
- Communications and Process Control.
- File management
- Unix system calls
